# MERN Stack App

A simple full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** to demonstrate end-to-end JavaScript development, from frontend UI to backend APIs and database integration.

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** – Frontend UI built with reusable components and client-side routing  
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for the backend server  
- **Express.js** – REST API handling requests, routing, and middleware  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Used across the entire stack

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Full-stack JavaScript development  
- Frontend ↔ backend communication via REST APIs  
- CRUD operations with MongoDB  
- Component-based UI development in React  
- Clean separation between client and server
